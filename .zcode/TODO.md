# Lumen open work

Extracted 2026-11-02 from the archived agent memories (`.zcode/memories/`), the ADRs' own
status sections, and the working tree. The ADRs are authoritative for detail; keep this list
current when an item closes.

## Now

- [ ] **Commit/PR the ADR-013 settings-app tree** — Phases A–G implemented, 134/134 tests
  green (incl. `test_ui_inputs`, `test_settings_ui`, `test_config_edit`); the app presents on
  the automatic tier against a headless compositor; `lumen-ctl devices/outputs/version` answer
  live. Working tree is uncommitted.
- [ ] **ADR-013 open item 1: in-window key capture** for the bindings editor (wl_keyboard
  keysym recording; the text grammar is the complete fallback today).
- [ ] **ADR-013 open item 2: per-device override editor + window-rules UI** — both are
  schema-side rows in `lumen-settings` waiting on their own compositor feature (rule store
  behind the inert `zlm_window_rules_v1`; `[[input.device]]` override plumbing), not on the app.

## Host-limited gates (ADR-010; VM cannot close these)

- [ ] **G2 p95**: S2 301-node panel clock frame — p50 passes (95 µs), p95 490–540 µs vs 150 µs
  budget; biggest lever is reshaping the clock label. (ADR-010 §8 says host wake jitter.)
- [ ] **G7 cold on GL**: p95 135–156 ms vs 150 ms budget — driver cost (EGL + Mesa compiles +
  fontconfig ≈103 ms), Lumen ≈5 ms; no GL program binaries on SVGA3D; build-ahead measured
  and rejected.
- [ ] **G11 frame rule** (no frame > 2× median) — VM jitter; passed on a quiet host.
- [ ] **Explicit sync on the wire** untested: no syncobj manager headless, no timeline
  syncobjs on vmwgfx. Needs hardware.

## Notebook (`iritur`) checks pending — user runs these

- [ ] PRIME offload (PR #71): an app launched "using discrete GPU" should report the
  GTX 950M (look for `shell.apps` "GPUs:" lines). switcheroo-control is not on the VM.
- [ ] Commit a notebook `ui-bench` baseline (`iritur-08fd3c`).
- [ ] Hardware Vulkan numbers (RADV/ANV class): host_image_copy upload path keep/revert,
  shared pipeline-cache gain, thread-scheduling tiers re-measure (reverted on GL),
  fence-deadline effect.

## Parked (one fix round each, or waiting for a port)

- [ ] **GL reset recovery** (raise-the-bar S2, reverted): capture cursor lost after reset.
- [ ] **Rounded corners / window shadows** (raise-the-bar F1, reverted): radius 30–32 masked
  client top corners; GL zeroed arrays per draw.
- [ ] **Shell background render cache + loop order**: still only in unpushed WIP c8d4499 on
  `claude/shell-first-paint` (old base) — port onto current main, then bench/tests/docs.
- [ ] **Tiling unbuilt** (ADR-012 trade-offs): pointer-drag split resize, orientations,
  monocle/dwindle.
- [ ] Non-text drag-and-drop with a real app on the real display (uri-list/icon/ask shipped
  and smoke-tested only).

## Do not re-open without new evidence

highp shaders, frozen test clock, malloc replacement, SDR-through-sRGB-view, GL build-ahead,
shell-side tiling, area-filter cost at non-integer render scales — see
`.zcode/skills/lumen-decisions/`.
